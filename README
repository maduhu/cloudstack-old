Hello, and thanks for downloading the Cloud.com CloudStack™!  The 
Cloud.com CloudStack™ is Open Source Software that allows 
organizations to build Infrastructure as a Service (Iaas) clouds.  
Working with server, storage, and networking equipment of your 
choice, the CloudStack provides a turn-key software stack that 
dramatically simplifies the process of deploying and managing a 
cloud.

REALLY QUICK START: BUILDING AND INSTALLING A PRODUCTION STACK
---------------------------------------------------------------------


You have two options.  Choose one:

a) Building distribution packages from the source and installing them
b) Building from the source and installing directly from there


=== I want to build and install distribution packages ===

This is the recommended way to run your CloudStack cloud.  The
advantages are that dependencies are taken care of automatically
for you, and you can verify the integrity of the installed files
using your system's package manager.

1. As root, install the build dependencies.

   a) Fedora / CentOS: ./waf installrpmdeps
   
   b) Ubuntu: ./waf installdebdeps
   
2. As a non-root user, build the CloudStack packages.

   a) Fedora / CentOS: ./waf rpm
   
   b) Ubuntu: ./waf deb
   
3. As root, install the CloudStack packages.
   You can choose which components to install on your system.

   a) Fedora / CentOS: the installable RPMs are in artifacts/rpmbuild
   
   b) Ubuntu: the installable DEBs are in artifacts/debbuild

4. Configure and start the components you intend to run.
   See "Setting the CloudStack components up" to find out how to
   configure each component, and "Installation paths" for information
   on where programs, initscripts and config files are installed.


=== I want to build and install directly from the source ===

This is the recommended way to run your CloudStack cloud if you
intend to modify the source, if you intend to port the CloudStack to
another distribution, or if you intend to run the CloudStack on a
distribution for which packages are not built.

1. As root, install the build dependencies.
   See below for a list.

2. As non-root, configure the build.
   See below to discover configuration options.

   ./waf configure

3. As non-root, build the CloudStack.
   To learn more, see "Quick guide to developing, building and
   installing from source" below.

   ./waf build

4. As root, install the runtime dependencies.
   See below for a list.
   
5. As root, Install the CloudStack

   ./waf install
   
6. Configure and start the components you intend to run.
   See "Setting the CloudStack components up" to find out how to
   configure each component, and "Installation paths" for information
   on where programs, initscripts and config files are installed.


=== Dependencies of the CloudStack ===

- Build dependencies:

   1. FIXME DEPENDENCIES LIST THEM HERE

- Runtime dependencies:

   2. FIXME DEPENDENCIES LIST THEM HERE


---------------------------------------------------------------------
POST-INSTALL: SETTING THE CLOUDSTACK COMPONENTS UP
---------------------------------------------------------------------


The CloudStack installs several components on your system.

Each component usually installs an initscript on your system, along
with one configuration command that will set your system up to run
said component properly.  You must set each component up before
you can run it.  The Installation Manual will guide you through the
process of setting each component up, and the section "Installation
paths" will explain where to find the installed files and what each
$VARIABLE means.


=== cloud-management: the Management Server ===

This Tomcat-based service runs your cloud and lets you manage it.
Its initscript is called cloud-management, and its setup command is
called cloud-setup-databases.


=== cloud-usage: the Usage Monitor ===

This Java-based service accounts usage metrics for your cloud.
Its initscript is called cloud-usage, and it takes its configuration
from the Management Server, so to set the Usage Monitor up, set the
management server up.


=== cloud-agent: the Cloud Agent ===

This Java-based service runs virtual machines based on orders from
the Management Service, connecting to it at startup.  Its initscript
is called cloud-agent, and its setup command is called cloud-setup-agent.


=== cloud-console-proxy: the Cloud Console Proxy ===

This Java-based service provides access to virtual machine consoles
based on orders from the Management Service, connecting to it at
startup.  Its initscript is called cloud-console-proxy, and its setup
command is called cloud-setup-console-proxy.


=== cloud-vnet: the Cloud Virtual Networking Arbiter ===

This C-based service provides network virtualization and isolation for
virtual machines based on security settings established by the cloud
operator.  Its initscript is called cloud-vnet; it requires no setup.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLATION PATHS: WHERE THE STACK IS INSTALLED ON YOUR SYSTEM
---------------------------------------------------------------------


The CloudStack build system installs files on a variety of paths, each
one of which is selectable when building from source.

- $PREFIX:
	the default prefix where the entire stack is installed
	defaults to /usr/local on source builds
	defaults to /usr on package builds
	
- $SYSCONFDIR/cloud:
	
	the prefix for CloudStack configuration files
	defaults to $PREFIX/etc/cloud on source builds
	defaults to /etc/cloud on package builds
	
- $SYSCONFDIR/init.d:
	the prefix for CloudStack initscripts
	defaults to $PREFIX/etc/init.d on source builds
	defaults to /etc/init.d on package builds
	
- $BINDIR:
	the CloudStack installs programs there
	defaults to $PREFIX/bin on source builds
	defaults to /usr/bin on package builds
	
- $LIBEXECDIR:
	the CloudStack installs service runners there
	defaults to $PREFIX/libexec on source builds
	defaults to /usr/libexec on package builds (/usr/bin on Ubuntu)


---------------------------------------------------------------------
UNINSTALLING THE CLOUDSTACK FROM YOUR SYSTEM
---------------------------------------------------------------------


If you installed the CloudStack using packages, use your operating
system package manager to remove the CloudStack packages.

If you installed from the source:    ./waf uninstall

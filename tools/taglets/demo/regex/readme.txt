Taglets Collection - Regex Demo
================================================================================


Regular Expression Demo
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains what used to be the Demo Application for the Taglets
Collection. As of version 2.0 this demo no longer serves as a show case for
the output generated by the Taglets Collection. However since the demo is still
useful to test replacements done by taglets using the "RegexTextFilter" like
for example the "RegexBlockTaglet" and the "RegexInlineTaglet" we have decided
to include it in the distribution.


Starting the Regex Demo
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Regex Demo comes in form of an executable Java Archive. To launch it

- Doubleclick "regex.jar" (if a JRE is assigned to handle "*.jar" files).
- Execute "java -jar regex.jar".

The Regex Demo requires a J2RE 1.4 or higher.


Help
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The demo includes a simple help that explains the various text panes and gives
an example on how to use the regex replacer.

For more information about the "RegexTextFilter" and its uses please consult 
the user guide of the Taglets Collection included in the "doc" folder of your
taglets distribution.
